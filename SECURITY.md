## Reporting a Vulnerability

If you discover a security vulnerability in ShibaClaw, **please report it responsibly**.

### How to Report

1. **Email**: Send details to **security@shibaclaw.dev** (or open a private advisory on GitHub).
2. **GitHub Security Advisories**: Use the [Report a Vulnerability](https://github.com/RikyZ90/ShibaClaw/security/advisories/new) form on this repository.

**Do NOT** open a public issue for security vulnerabilities.

### What to Include

- A description of the vulnerability and its potential impact.
- Steps to reproduce or a minimal proof-of-concept.
- The affected version(s) and component(s) (e.g. `security/network.py`, `agent/tools/shell.py`).

### What to Expect

- **Acknowledgement** within 48 hours.
- **Triage & Assessment** within 7 days.
- **Fix Timeline**: Critical/High severity fixes are targeted within 14 days of confirmation. Medium/Low within 30 days.
- **Credit**: Reporters will be credited in the release notes unless they prefer anonymity.

## Security Architecture

ShibaClaw implements defense-in-depth across multiple layers:

### Agent Execution

- **Shell deny-list**: The `exec` tool blocks 20+ dangerous patterns (fork bombs, `rm -rf /`, `sudo`, hex/unicode-encoded obfuscation, command substitution, `curl|bash`) before execution.
- **Install audit**: `pip install` commands are scanned for known CVEs via `pip-audit`. `npm install` commands are scanned via `npm audit`. Severity threshold is configurable (`installAuditBlockSeverity`).
- **Tool output truncation**: LLM context is protected from overflow via configurable character caps on tool results.
- **Structural randomized wrapping**: A random nonce is regenerated each turn and used to fence tool outputs, mitigating prompt injection from untrusted content. This core defense mechanism (Randomized Tool Output Wrapping or RTOW) has been decoupled and packaged as a standalone, zero-dependency Python library called [Muzzle](https://github.com/RikyZ90/Muzzle) so you can easily protect any AI agent framework.
- **Untrusted content banner**: Web-fetched content is explicitly marked with `[UNTRUSTED EXTERNAL CONTENT]` delimiters.
- **Workspace sandboxing**: File tools and the WebUI file browser are constrained to the configured workspace root.

### Network Security (SSRF Protection)

- All outbound fetches validate URLs against a blocklist of private/internal IP ranges (RFC 1918, CGN, link-local, loopback, IPv6 unique-local).
- DNS resolution results are checked before and after HTTP redirects.
- `resolve_and_pin()` provides DNS-rebinding-safe validation: resolved IPs are pinned so a second lookup cannot return a different (internal) address.

### Authentication

- WebUI auth uses a randomly generated bearer token validated with `hmac.compare_digest()` (constant-time) for both HTTP and Socket.IO authentication.
- The auth token is never included in file-serving URLs to prevent leakage via server logs or browser history.
- Socket.IO connections require authentication (not in the public path list).

### Channel Access Control

- Every channel enforces an `allow_from` whitelist. An empty list denies all access.
- The `ChannelManager` validates `allow_from` at startup and terminates if a configured channel still has an empty `allow_from`, forcing explicit access configuration.

### Rate Limiting

- The `MessageBus` supports optional per-sender rate limiting (`rate_limit_per_minute`). Disabled by default — enable it in config if exposed to untrusted users.

### Container Security

- **Base Image**: Uses `debian:bookworm-slim` via the Astral `uv` image.
- **Auto-Upgrade**: The `Dockerfile` includes an explicit `apt-get upgrade -y` step during build to ensure the latest security patches for system libraries (like `openssl` and `glibc`) are applied, regardless of the base image's refresh cycle.
- **Scanner Integration**: Official images are scanned on Docker Hub. High and Critical vulnerabilities in system packages are addressed via build-time upgrades or base image updates.
